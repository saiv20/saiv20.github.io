I am a graduate student at Northeastern University, where I am pursuing my Master's in Robotics. My interests primarily lie in Vision, Navigation, and Control of Autonomous Systems. I previously worked as a Project Research Assistant in the robotics group at TIH-IoT, IIT Bombay. I completed my Bachelor's degree (B.E.) in Mechanical Engineering with a Minor in Robotics and Automation from BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus.
