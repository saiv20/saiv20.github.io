Hello there!
<p align="justify">
I am a graduate student at Northeastern University, where I am pursuing my Master's in Robotics. My interests primarily lie in Motion Planning and Computer Vision. At Northeastern, I am actively delving into the intricacies of autonomous systems, seeking a profound understanding of their elements. Currently, I am looking for Co-op opportunities.
</p>
<p align="justify">
In the course of my previous professional roles, I actively engaged in <strong>Path Planning, Computer Vision and Control for Autonomous Systems</strong>. A significant portion of my responsibilities involved leveraging Robot Operating System (ROS), Python, MATLAB, and C++ to design and implement solutions.  
</p>
<p align="justify">
I pursued my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering with a Minor in Robotics and Automation from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani. During this time, I worked on applications of Artificial Intelligence in Mechanical Systems.
