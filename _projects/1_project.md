The project involved the development of a fleet of ground robots, each featuring an ArUco marker positioned atop. The core objective was to establish precise localization capabilities for these robots within an environment using computer vision. To achieve this, a ceiling-mounted camera was deployed, and ArUco marker detection and object tracking was implemented through OpenCV and Python. This facilitated real-time tracking and localization of the robots.
