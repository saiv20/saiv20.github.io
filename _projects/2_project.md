This project involved the acquisition and analysis of real-time odometry and camera data from Northeastern University's autonomous car, NUANCE. The primary objective was to implement Visual SLAM using ORBSLAM3 and perform dead reckoning on the collected rosbag. The magnetometer was calibrated and the data was fused with gyroscope data using a complementary filter to provide a more accurate estimate of the orientation. This filtered yaw and position estimate was used for dead reckoning.
